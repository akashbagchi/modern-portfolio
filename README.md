# Modern Portfolio Website

A sophisticated portfolio website showcasing modern web development practices. Built with a focus on user experience, performance, and clean architecture, this project demonstrates expertise in contemporary front-end development and UI/UX design principles.

## Technical Architecture

This portfolio website is engineered using cutting-edge web technologies, emphasizing type safety, component reusability, and maintainable code architecture:

### Frontend Development

The frontend leverages the power of Vue 3's Composition API through Nuxt 3, providing excellent developer ergonomics and runtime performance. Key technical implementations include:

- Server-side rendering (SSR) for optimal performance and SEO
- Dark mode support with system preference detection and smooth transitions
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Custom composables for state management and business logic
- Type-safe component props and events using TypeScript
- PrimeVue components with custom theming for consistent UI/UX

### Backend Integration

The project features a robust backend architecture:

- PostgreSQL database hosted on Neon.tech for project data management
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- RESTful API endpoints built with Nuxt's server handlers
- Environment-based configuration management

### Development Tooling

The development environment is configured for maximum productivity and code quality:

- TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer experience
- ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style
- Husky for Git hooks and automated quality checks
- pnpm for efficient package management
- Hot module replacement for rapid development
